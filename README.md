An inventory app for Android. The app is intended for home use and allows users to keep track of and organize their belongings. The app encourages users to regularly use the logging feature to indicate whenever they have used an item. This is so that it will know how frequently the user has used each of their belongings. It uses this logged data to create charts that display usage statistics and to create notifications that suggest that the user discard or sell items that they do not frequently use. 

Also included, is a room organizer feature that allows users to represent different rooms in their house with simple shapes on a 2D top down interface. Users can drag and drop different shapes to represent the layout of their rooms and they can give the shapes names and photos to better identify them.
