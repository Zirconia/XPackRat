# XPackRat
An inventory and reminder app for Android. The app is intended for home use and allows users to keep track of their belongings. The app encourages users to regularly use the logging feature to indicate whenever they have used an item. This is so that it will know how frequently the user has used each of their belongings. It uses this logged data to create charts(via the MPAndroidChart library) that display usage data and to create reminder notifications that suggest that the user discard, sell or donate items that they do not frequently use. The reminders are intended to help users become less of a pack rat little by little, as the app's name implies.
